# 1. Predicting Profits for a Restaurant Franchise üç¥

In this project, we aim to predict profits for a restaurant franchise by implementing a linear regression model. The model will be based on various factors, providing valuable insights into the profitability of different branches of the franchise.

## 2. House Pricing üí∞
In the second part of the project, we shift our focus to predicting house prices using linear regression with multiple variables. We'll explore how different features like house size and the number of bedrooms affect house prices.

## 3. Linear Regression using Scikit-Learn
In this section, we utilize Scikit-Learn, a powerful machine learning library in Python, to perform linear regression. We'll predict house prices using this library, showcasing an alternative approach to solving regression problems.
